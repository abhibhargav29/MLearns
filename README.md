# MLearns

Welcome to Machine Learns, we have here implemented various machine learning models using various techniquesand compared them side by side with sklearn's implementations in terms 
of accuracy(for classification) and r2 score(for regression). We use iris dataset for the classification and boston house prices dataset for regression. The output of each file
is one or mode graphs comparing accuracies of our and sklearn's model on various values of hyperparameters. The more close these graphs are to a straight line, the better is our 
implementation(considering sklearn's model a benchmark).
